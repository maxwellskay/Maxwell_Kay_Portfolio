# Some Recent Visualisations

Some recent visualisations I made for assignments. 
 
### Mother’s vs Father’s Age for Married and Unmarried White Parents in 2020
![](https://github.com/maxwellskay/Maxwell_Kay_Portfolio/blob/main/images/Portfolio%20Binned%20Scatterplots%203.png)
*These binned scatterplots use data from the 2020 Nativity Public Use File from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC publishes such data every year for public research and analysis. Ages are put into bins of 2 years starting at 16. Data about births with parents younger than 16 or older than 50, or where the age of one parent is unknown, is not shown. Notice the scale of each scatterplot, that there are many more married births than unmarried.*
